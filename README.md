# A linux mini command shell in C++

Strat myShell by typing the following commands:

```bash
make
./myShell
```

After myShell starts, it will print a prompt in the following format:

```bash
myShell:~/ece551/mp_miniproject $
```

Do the testing by typing the command after the prompt and hit ENTER.

After testing finished, terminate the program by "exit".
